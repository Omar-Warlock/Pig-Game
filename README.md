## 📖 About the Project
The **Pig Dice Game** is a fun and strategic **2-player dice game** where the goal is simple:  
**Be the first to score 100 points!** 🏆

---

### 🎯 How to Play
1. Players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die.  
2. **If you roll a 1** → your turn ends and your current turn score resets to 0.  
3. **If you roll 2–6** → the number is added to your *current turn score*.  
4. At any time, you can **Hold** to:  
   - Add your *current turn score* to your *total score*.  
   - Pass the turn to the other player.  
5. The first player to reach **100 points** wins!
